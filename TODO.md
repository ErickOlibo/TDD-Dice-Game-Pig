# ASSIGNMENT 2 - TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
This assignment uses the TDD approach to creating softwares. This page will be updated as we go along with the making of the assignment.

As we are using TDD we will follow:
- [The Three Rules of TDD](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-c-programming/9781941222423/f_0055.html). Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob") provides a consise set of rules
  1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
  2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
  3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.

Rule #1 says to write tests first—understand and specify, in the form of a unit test example, behavior you must build into the system.

Rule #2 says to proceed as incrementally as possible—after each line you write, get feedback (via compilation or test run) if you can before moving on.


## TODO LIST
below is the list of classes and methods to incorporate in the design and development.



## ORGANIZATION and DISTRIBUTION of TASKS

### As the title indicates, we will have a file to document who does what!
- Timeline of tasks 
- Revision
- Comments
- Etc...


### Interesting read and URLs
